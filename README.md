# Quickstart Guide

This guide will walk you through different methods to achieve the desired outcome. Here's what we'll cover:

## Methods:

1. **Simple LLM Chain**: This method relies solely on information provided in the prompt template to generate a response.

2. **Retrieval Chain**: We'll build a retrieval chain that fetches data from a separate database and integrates it into the prompt template.

3. **Conversation Retrieval Chain**: We'll enhance the retrieval chain by incorporating chat history, allowing for a chat-like interaction with the LLM. It retains memory of previous questions and responses.
